# Guess_the_number
This is a game that generates a number which you will have to guess.

Description: After starting the game you will be asked to choose a difficulty (if you are new to these types of logical games I advise you to chose "easy"). There are three levels of difficulty "easy", "medium" and "hard". 

EASY: The "easy" mode will generate a random 4 digit number for you. All the digits in the number will be different. This means cases like (2233, 1291, 1288, 9942...) will not occur. Since this is "easy" all the digits will be selected in the range (1-9), zero will not be in the number. You will also have the option to sellect the number of atempts (max 20) before the game ends. Each time you make a guess the game will tell you how many of the digits you got right and how many positions you gor correct. (If the number to find is "1234" and you guess "5246" you will have two correct digits 2 and 4 and one correct possition the "2") If you guessed the number before finishing your attempts, the game will congratulate you and tell you the number to find. If you do not guess the number within the given attempts, the game will tell you that it is over and show you what the number to find was. 

MEDIUM: Here the rules are exactly the same as the one for the "easy" mode, however here you are plaing with digits in the range (0-9). This means that zero could be in the number. Everything else is the same.

HARD: !!!ONLY FOR PROFESSIONALS!!! Here the rules are exactly the same as the ones for "medium" mode with the small difference that in "hard" mode the game will give you the option to choose how many digits you would like your number to have. So instead of 4 digits as in the previous modes here you can select to guess a number with up to 10 digits.

Hope you will enjoy! Best of luck.
